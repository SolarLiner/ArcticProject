					<p><em>1784</em>- A team of explorer’s sets off to the pole, they find something in the ice, but before they can get back they go missing mysteriously.
Nowadays- Another team of explorer’s sets off for the pole, there mission is to collect surface samples from the most northerly point on Planet Kerbin.</p>

					<p>&#x21E5;They land their plane just outside of an arctic village, the inhabitants tell them not to go any further or the gods will punish them for their sins.
					They decide to travel by car and set off forgetting the advice the tribe had given them. 
					A large alien structure emerges through the snow storm, it towers several hundred metres in the sky. They report the findings back to base.</p>

				    <p>&#x21E5;2 Years after discovery- The site is awash with scientists and structures researching the alien structure. The structure activates and the scientists find out that it is
				   	sending a signal to another planet.
					A board meeting is held between all countries of Kerbin determining what to do. They set up Project Arctic, a one way mission to the planet to investigate the receiver. Scene finishes
					with a image of	Project Arctic badge, which fades into the next scene with a badge on the side of a craft.</p>
					
					<p>&#x21E5;4 Years after discovery- The ship is finished in space and has had final checks and the crew docked. The scientist is the same Kerbal who discovered the structure,
					he is the main character.
					The crew goes into cryostasis and the ship jumps to the alien location.</p>
					
					<p>&#x21E5;8 Years after discovery- The ship arrives at the planet and the crew come out of cryostasis, a shuttle is launched and lands on the planets surface. The surface resembles
					LV 426 in looks and is my inspiration. The crew use rovers to travel closer to the receiver. They come to a ridge and peak over revealing a huge alien structure with bio domes and
					other technologies.
					The crew enter the structure and find it is counting down. They investigate what it is doing and who built it. Before long the team members begin to disappear one by one,
					the survivors eventually find their way out and take off in the shuttle.</p>
					
					<p>&#x21E5;It re-docks with the mothership and finds that whatever was down there with them has managed to come aboard.
					After desperately trying to find out what the countdown is for, they discover that it is until the receiver sends a message for Kerbin structure to self destruct killing the planet.
					The crew now down to one decides to ram the receiver resulting in a spectacular explosion.
					The film ends with the camera pulling back to reveal thousands of receivers. </p></div>
